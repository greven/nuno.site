      "summary": "The increasing popularity of mobile devices, such as smartphones, has changed the way people access and manage data. In particular, with the increased capabilities of mobile phones, many services are now available and routinely used on the go (e.g., home banking, e-commerce, remote work, internet access and entertainment). As a result, more and more confidential data is now stored on these devices, which significantly increases the risk of information or identity theft by non-authorized access to the mobile device. In this paper, a native biometric recognition system for the Android platform is proposed, offering an additional layer of security when accessing mobile services or important data. The proposed biometric system is based on palmprint features using the Orthogonal Line Ordinal Features (OLOF) extraction technique, achieving promising results in terms of recognition accuracy and speed for a mobile device"
