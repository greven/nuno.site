<p class="lead">Well, well, well. Look who decided to show up.</p>

I've been on and off creating a new personal site for a while now, probably on the ballpark of 10 years now. There is always something more important,
normally work related, that gets in the way of personal projects. When you work for others and spend most of your free time learning new things,
creating a personal website and blogging is often the last thing on your mind.

I've been wanting to create a personal site that is more than just a static site generator with a blog. I want it to be a place where
I can share my thoughts, my projects, my journey as a developer, but also to share what I read, what I listen to and what I play.
A place where I can experiment with new technologies and ideas and write about it. specially in the realm of Elixir, the Beam and Phoenix,
which has been my main focus for the past few years.
