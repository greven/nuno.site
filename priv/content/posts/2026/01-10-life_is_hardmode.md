I’m often asked why I enjoy playing games that are hard and punishing, like _Elden Ring_, _Hades_, or _Hollow Knight_.

One could argue that life itself is already on hard mode, where effort doesn’t always translate into reward.
So why seek out difficulty in games, especially when they’re supposed to offer escapism and relaxation?

I do enjoy calm and relaxing games too. But sometimes, unlike many aspects of life you want to feel that,
getting better, learning from failure and persisting does _pay off_. So for me, enjoying games that are hard,
is actually about the satisfaction of accomplishment that comes **because** of the hardship.
